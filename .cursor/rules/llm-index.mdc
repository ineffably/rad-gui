let's create a file called .llm.reference.md 
in that file place an entire lookup catalog of this codebase as an LLM or agent would easily digest it
it doesn't need to be human readable, but, should be reasonably verbose. 
make sure this is updated regularly.

here is an example plain text entry from pixijs:
TITLE: Loading Textures and Creating Sprites in PixiJS Using TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript snippet demonstrates asynchronously loading an image texture with PixiJS's Assets loader, then using the loaded texture to create Sprite objects. It includes three ways to create sprites: passing a texture instance directly, passing texture as an options object, and creating a sprite from a texture cached by the loader using Sprite.from(). The snippet requires the PixiJS library and assumes the 'myTexture.png' asset is available on the server. The input is the texture name as a string, and the output is Sprite instances ready for use in the scene graph. This approach handles asynchronous loading and caching of textures efficiently, permitting reuse and optimal performance.

LANGUAGE: TypeScript
CODE:
```
const texture = await Assets.load('myTexture.png');

// pass a texture explicitly
const sprite = new Sprite(texture);
// as options
const sprite2 = new Sprite({texture});
// from the cache as the texture is loaded
const sprite3 = Sprite.from('myTexture.png')
```
